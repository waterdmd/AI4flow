# AI4flow

AI4flow is a machine learning framework designed for hydrological forecasting. This project supports a research paper currently under review at the *Science of the Total Environment* journal.

## Notes

- **Model Evaluation:** Currently evaluates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models with ongoing tests for Transformers and other architectures.
- **Metrics:** Utilizes evaluation metrics adapted from the [NeuralHydrology](https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology) repository.

## Development Status

We are actively developing AI4flow to enhance its hydrological forecasting capabilities. Currently, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are fully operational and have demonstrated promising results. However, the implementation and evaluation of Transformer-based models and other architectures are still underway. We are working to integrate these models and assess their performance to provide more robust and accurate forecasting solutions.
